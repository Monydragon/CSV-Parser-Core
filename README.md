WELCOME TO THE CSV PARSER & CSV Duplicate Column Checker. This program was developed and designed by Mony Dragon.

   This was rapidly put together to showcase some of my programming experience while interpreting the task provided through a job interview assignment.
   
   Let me explain what the purpose for this application and why I developed it the way I did and why I decided to design and architect it the way I did.
   
   
   I designed this around .Net Core I wanted to use .Net Core since it can be used on nearly any platform and truly allows this code to be executed/published to multiple target platforms.
   I programmed this initially to be a console based application since the assignment did not specify if I needed to create a method or a program so I decided on the latter.
   I want to put emphasis that this code is by no means what my production code would look like. I follow Dev/Test/Prod release and development cycles.
   
   What I could do if provided a position working in a professional capacity. I could use Unit Testing and Perform TDD if needed. Follow proper code standards per company req
   This codebase can be manipulated as needed I will be releasing this Open Source GPL 0. Please look into the licensing terms for Public Domain.
   
   I hope this is sufficient I quickly put this together, If I was being paid to develop programs/applications/games professionally the quality would be heavily improved.
   Please email me any questions or comments or concerns you have with my code or this project at Monydragon@gmail.com
